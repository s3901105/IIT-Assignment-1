					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Hi! My name is Collin Ng, and I’m in my first year of bachelor or IT. I was born in Malaysia and when I was 4 years old my family migrating to Melbourne, which is where we’ve been living ever since. I graduated from Highvale Secondary College in 2020, but because I’m an 2003 baby I’m still 17 (unless you’re reading this after April 13th). I grew up in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne so my family and I are pretty westernised, and my siblings and I can only speak English, but we do still celebrate Asian cultural events like Chinese New Year. <br><br>I’m super into basketball, skateboarding, playing videogames (valorant got me cramming this assignment), working out in my backyard, and since Uni started, I’ve been really enjoying meeting new people and experiencing the Uni life. Recently I got my Ls, so I’ve been really getting into driving cars and car designs, especially the street car culture (JDM cars are so nice to look at). I’m also keen to start going clubbing once I turn 18, all my mates can go, and they aren’t afraid of reminding me every Friday night.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I have always had an interest in technology since I was young, I remember always begging my mum to let me use her Nokia (one of those indestructible brick phones) to play snake and when I was bored, I would explore the menus and different apps on it. But once my dad brought home his new iPhone 3g I was hooked, and I spent all day using it and find even the simplest things like browsing through the iTunes store so intriguing. Over time my fascination with all thing’s tech related only grew, to the point where I built my own pc along with installing a OS all by myself (with the help of YouTube) a couple years ago. It felt like a massive achievement when I booted the pc for the first time, and I heard the loud ass case fans whirring along with the copious amount of RGB light up my room. This experience cemented my decision to pursue studies in information technology. I also studied VCE software development, which admittedly was not my best subject but the one I enjoyed the most. <br><br> Before the COVID lockdowns, I attended a few Uni open days in year 11 to look for some potential universities. I had heard good things about Monash and RMIT, so when I visited the Uni’s I made sure to ask a lot of questions. I settled on RMIT as they have a good reputation for having strong IT courses. The fact it was also in the city and I could engage with the Melbourne culture and wider RMIT community also contributed to my decision. Initially I aimed to get into a Bachelor of Computer Science, but as I did more research, I realised my passions and interests were more align with Bachelor of IT. <br><br> At the moment I do not have any solid plans as to what to do after I complete my bachelors, whether it be to continue my studies and specialise in a specific IT field or go straight into finding an IT based full-time job. Being in my first year my main goal is to experiment and try different fields of IT to discover what I’m good at and what I’m not, as well as what I enjoy.

				<h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Cyber Security Analyst</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>Although I still want to experiment with different IT fields and specialties, as of now I am leaning towards something in the cybersecurity field. More specifically a cybersecurity analyst.</p>
					<a href="https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=f6bdb5222f3b44a4&tk=1f1hij593rj9p800&from=serp&vjs=3">Here is a potential dream job.</a><br><br>
					<p>A cyber security analyst has the primary responsibility of protecting a company’s networks, systems, as well as the personal data of both employees and customers. They are in charge of implementing threat protection measures and security controls. They also have to keep up with the up-and-coming technological advancements in order to survey how these advancements can be used by potential hackers or maybe even utilised to protect a company from threats. This area of IT I find the most exciting because of how you are in constant need to check and improve a company’s defences, and understanding from a potential threats point of view and how to stop their attacks. <p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>Right now I have next to no experience in coding (basic knowledge of python, html, visual basic). I do have a good understanding of how to navigate windows 10, how to assemble basic computer hardware and a good understanding of how each component works. I can also navigate both Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. </p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>A cyber security analyst will have to have a wide range of skills at their disposal. They need to be able to understand a wide variety of coding languages, have a strong knowledge of how potential threats can be used against the company’s IT infrastructure, as well as understanding from a hacker’s point of view how they behave and think in order to defend a company from them.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>I plan to obtain a lot of my skills required through my bachelor of IT (learn more coding languages, gain knowledge on computer systems and networks, etc) and then if I still want to pursue cyber security as a career, I will continue my studies with a masters of cybersecurity which allows me to refine the skills needed to be a cybersecurity analyst.</p>

					<h2>Truity.com -  Big Five Personality Test</h2>
					<br>
          <p><img src="truity.png" alt="truity" width="500"/></p>
					<p>This Big Five assessment measures your scores on five major dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes abbreviated OCEAN). I scored the highest in Extraversion (83%), being described as a person’s inclination to seek stimulation from the outside world, especially in the form of attention from other people. My lowest score is conscientiousness (15%), meaning I have a very weak ability to exercise self-discipline and control in order to pursue my goals. Openness describes a person’s tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. Agreeableness describes a person’s tendency to put others’ needs ahead of their own, and to cooperate rather than compete with others. Neuroticism describes a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, and shame.</p>

				<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
				<p>These results from the different tests I took gave a me good insight into my personality and how I interact with other people around me. Its almost creepy how accurate the information they provide is to how I behave, and my attitudes are. After taking the tests, I now know what my strengths and weaknesses are, so I know how I behave in certain situations and make a conscious effort to change the bad habits and tendencies I have. I also know the things that I am good at, so I can use these strengths to my advantage when I need to do things.</p>
				<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
				<p>In a team these results will have a massive affect on how I behave in a group or team environment. A team requires all its members to communicate properly and accurately, so being extraverted and more outgoing will allow me to do that easily. Me having a tactile/kinaesthetic learning style also means when learning new content and discovering more knowledge for a project means a little more effort must be put in. For example, unlike visual learning where you can read words of a page, or oral learning here someone can just recite it to you, tactile requires a more hands on approach. This means I would need to use the software/hardware or whatever I need to learn to retain knowledge about it.</p>
				<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
				<p>When forming my team, I should consider the different personalities and learning styles potential team members will have. Having people with similar learning styles in a team would make it easier to advance a project, as all team members will be able to quickly understand what is needed. Whereas if there are different people with different learning styles having to accommodate the way information is presented will be less efficient. More importantly, some personalities can clash with others or not work well together. For example, an impulsive team member may not work well together with someone who is more analytical and prefers to take their time making decisions. For me being a highly extraverted (91%) I would perform best when the whole team meets up physically. I am also prospecting (79%) meaning I would be flexible with different options and open to different options.</p>

				<h1>My Project Idea: Hoop Stats™</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>I have decided to develop a smartphone app that tracks the performance and statistics of a player during official basketball games. Though we would assume that the player is also the user of the app, this is not strictly case it could be a parent of the player or a friend operating the software. This app will also be connected to a device that records the player during the game, allowing for cool replays and post-game analysis. Note that official basketball games are games played where there are teams who play in season-round competitions, with referees, team coaches, etc. There are also scorers who oversee putting points on the board when a team score, and they also record different statistics like fouls, layups, free throws, etc. All these statistics are submitted into a database which stores every single player’s data. The app will be able pull the data of the player from that database and display that data in a cleaner and more user-friendly way through the app as well as being able to graph trends in performance. If there is incomplete or inaccurate data, there is the option for the user to manually input data.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>One of my long-time hobbies is playing basketball, and I even used to play domestic basketball for a couple years. Using my interest in technology I can combine these two interests to create this Basketball stat tracker app. Basketball has always been a beloved sport among Australians and only increases in popularity, according to Basketball Australia as of March 2014 is the second highest team participation sport in Australia. This is especially true in Victoria, where figures released by the Australian Sports Commission's Exercise, Recreation and Sport Survey in 2010 showed that basketball was the most popular sport played in the state of Victoria. My app will allow players to further enhance their game as well as keep records of cool plays and shots taken in-game. In addition, with my extensive knowledge and experience with playing basketball both in a competition and casually, this makes it the perfect project for me.</p>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This software will be called Hoop Stats™ and will be a smartphone app to be used on iOS or android. The app will require some form of internet connection (from mobile data, Wi-Fi, etc.) to back up user data to a cloud storage system or they can plug their smartphone into a physical storage unit through USB. An internet connection is also needed to pull data from the database of players, but if the user opts to, they can input all the data from each game manually. Each user will have to register an account before starting to use the app with basic information like name, date of birth, email, gender, and create a username and password to log in with. After registering, the user will have to find their player profile on whatever database it is stored on. For example, I would find my team W18 GEBC Boys 14C (Winter season 2018 Great Eastern Bees Club boys’ group under 14s C grade) through my club’s web page. Here it will show all the players, and the user will input the link of the profile so the software can start receiving data. The user will also have to give the app permission to access the players data from whatever external database the stats are stored in. <br><br>These stats will be used by the app to create graphs showing the performance of the player with different variables over multiple games (e.g. graph showing an increase in 3 point shots taken per game), as well as outline strengths and weaknesses of their games (e.g. User shooting well from the 3 point line, or User is weak at shooting free throws). Even though the stats can be accessed from the organisation provided web page, the Hoop Stats™ will have a cleaner and more organised user interface which the user can navigate through better. The app will allow multiple users to operate on the same smartphone by allowing the current user to log out and log in. Before logging out, the user must sync all their data, whether it is through the internet to a cloud storage or by plugging the smartphone via USB to save it on a physical drive. <br><br>Another feature that I would like to add is the ability to use either the phone camera or an external camera to record the games. The user would prop up their phone facing the half of the court they are scoring on, and at half time when the teams swap directions the phone would be propped up on the other side. If they were using an external camera, a Bluetooth/USB function would be required to send the video footage from the camera to the smartphone. While recording there will be three functions: Start Recording, Stop Recording and Save Last 30 Seconds (30 is default, user can choose to change to 15 or 60 seconds). This recording feature will have 2 modes: Whole Match Mode or Action Replay Mode. The Whole Match Mode will record the whole game, and when the Save Last 30 Seconds function is used it will mark those last 30 seconds as a “Key Moment”, so when the user watches the footage after the game, they will have the whole match and moments marked when the function was activated. Action Replay Mode is similar where it records the game, but it only keeps the footage from the Save Last 30 Seconds function. This mode keeps storage requirements low and is recommended for a normal match, whereas the Whole Match Mode is more tailored for important games like the grand final matches or people who have a lot of storage and really wants to analyse their game.</p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>I plan to code using Android Studio, which requires knowledge in the language of Java. To code this I will be using my laptop, and in order to work on this project in a group setting I will be using Microsoft OneDrive. I also need access to a smartphone running on an android OS to troubleshoot and test the software. The smartphone should have a camera to use the recording feature. Constant stability of this camera while recording is also recommended for the user, so using some sort of phone stand or tripod for a camera would be a requirement. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Learning Java will take some time, so down the road I might consider switching to an alternate way of creating my software app as learning java may not be the most efficient way. I use an iPhone so developing my app for iOS may be a potential route I can take, but I have a basic idea on how to code android apps. There will be an option for the user to connect an external camera to record their basketball games, I will need to consider ways for the app to communicate with an external camera through Bluetooth or USB. I am considering using a go pro as an external camera to test, but if there are cheaper alternatives, I will use them instead.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>Once I have finished Hoop Stats™, I will continue to test it with users who are close friends and family. This project will help basketball players who play in official games fine tune and improve their performance by giving them a lot of feedback on how they play. On top of this, they will be able to track their progress to see how far they have come as a player and give them a strong sense of achievement. Allowing users to record cool highlights and moments only adds to the users feeling of accomplishment. This project will enable basketball enthusiast reach the potential they have as a player.</p>
